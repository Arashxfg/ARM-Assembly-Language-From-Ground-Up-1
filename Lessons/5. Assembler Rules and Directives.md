# Structure of an Assembly Module

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's look at a very simple module here:  
Over here the first line is where we put the directory and this is basically saying, name this block *FFT* and this is the code block. Therefore it's READ-ONLY.  
So we say `AREA` then we put a `name` *FFT* and then we say it's a `CODE` block. Meaning it's not a `DATA` block or any other blocks. And because it's `CODE` block, it's `READONLY`; Basically this is very typical.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over here, the second line marks the first instruction to be executed, so we put this `ENTRY` keyword to indicate this is the entry point of the assembly module.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This over here is a simple instruction to set up the parameters which we will see later. And over here this is another instruction to perform the arithmetic operation and in this case it's just a performed a simple addition. And this is how we typically write an infinite loop by using the **branch instruction** of `B` and all assembly files or modules need to end. So we have to `End` over here.

[Code_1](../code_files/1/main.s)


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's see another example, in our ARM cortex-M MCU, what we are going to do typically is if we using the `startup.s` file that comes when we create our project, we need to export our starting point to reset handler. Because we using the `startup.s` file we need to export it. If we are going to do with the `startup.s` file and we just want to open a project without MCU `startup.s` files, then we don't need this.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most of the time we are just going to create the project and add the `startup.s`. For that particular MCU and because of that, all we need to to is export the starting point of then program. So we need to say `EXPORT  start` over here.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`EXPORT` makes this call from other modules. So if we say `EXPORT  START` here, the next thing will be go to the reset handler and import this start.

# The ARM,Thumb and Thumb-2 Instruction Sets

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So `ARM` instructions are 32-bit wide and then were first used in the ARM 7TDMI, the ARM 9, ARM 10 and ARM 11 processors.  
`THUMB` instructions which are subset of `ARM` instructions also operated on 32-bit data. However, they are 16-bit wide.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example adding two 32-bit number together can be done in two ways :   
>ARM instruction : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   ADD  R0,R0,R2  
>THUMB instruction : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       ADD  R0,R2  

The first method using the `ARM` instruction takes R0 and R2 and adds them together, then stores the result back in register R0. The data contained in the those two registers as well as the `ARM` instruction itself is 32-bit wide.  
The second method using the `THUMB` instruction, we have got only 2 operands. And over here the instruction is only 16-bit wide. So one of the operation registers R0 acts as both source and destination of data. The `THUMB` instruction is supported on older processors.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`THUMB-2` is a subset of `THUMB` instruction and it includes new 32-bit instructions for more complex operations . So in other words, `THUMB-2` is a combination of both 16-bit and 32-bit instructions. Normally it's left to the compiler or assembler to choose the optimal size, but we as programmers can force the `ECU` if necessary.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some processor cores like cortex-M3 and cortex-M4 only execute the `THUMB-2` instruction, therefore there are no `ARM` instructions at all.  

> ARM instructions : ARM 7TDMI, ARM 9, ARM 10, ARM 11  
> THUMB-2 instruction : cortex-M   
> THUMB instruction : ARM 7TDMI, ARM 9, ARM 11, cortex-A, cortex-R


# Predefined Register Names

r0 _ r15   or   R0 _ R15    : *Registers in the ARM register bank*  

a1 _ a4     : *These registers are often used as registers for passing arguments or whatever result it's return or scratch registers, and these registers are actually are the same as R0 through R3*

sp  or SP   : *Stack pointer*  

lr  or  LR      : *Link register*

pc  or  PC      : *Program counter*

cpsr  or CPSR

spsr  or  SPSR

apsr  or APSR


# Frequently used Directives 

Directives ?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assist and control assembly process  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are also called `pseudo_ops`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not part of instruction set  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They change the way code is assembled  

Directives :   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`THUMB` : Placed at the top of the file to specify that code is generated with THUMB instructions.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CODE` : Denotes the section for machine instructions (ROM)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`DATA` : Denotes the section for global variables (RAM)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`AREA` : Instructs the assembler to assemble a new code or data section  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`SPACE` : Reserves a block of memory and fills it with zeros  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ALIGN` : Used to ensure nex object aligns properly  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`GLOBAL` : Same as `EXPORT`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`IMPORT` : To access an "exported" object  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`END` : Placed at the end of each file  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`DCB` : places byte (8-bits) sized constant into memory  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`DCW` : Places a half_word (16-bits) sized constant into memory  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`DCD` : Places a word (32-bits) sized constant into memory  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ECU` : To give a symbolic name to a numeric constant

***Every assembly program has to end with END at the end of the code.**  
***We need to add a feature to allow us to navigate our assembly code. So in order to be able to step through our assembly code, we need to enable something known as `MicroLIB` in `Target option` in `Keli uVision5`**



# Allocating space in memory with the SPACE Directive

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to allocate memory space , we just use te `SPACE` directive and then we give the value of space we want to allocate and this value is in `Bytes`.

# Assembly Operators

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this lesson we should take a look at assembly operators. So, primitive operations can be performed on data before it is used in an instruction. These operators apply to data. They are not part of an instruction. Operators can be used on a single value or two values and we can call operators that are used with a single value, `unary` operators, where operators that are used on two values are known as `binary` operators.

# Swapping Register Content

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this lesson we'll see how to change the contents of registers using boolean algebra. To be certain, we are going to use the `EXCLUSIVE OR` instruction to swap the contents oF registers.

# Renaming Registers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's just create some variables. So we say that the `RN` directive is used to `rename` a register, give the register our own name.  
The first line means whenever i want to call the register R1, I can just use the word VALl. This is just like using `EQU`.  

****Note that we used `EQU` for `Symbols`(symbolic number) but when it comes to the  registers, we can't use `EQU`***
