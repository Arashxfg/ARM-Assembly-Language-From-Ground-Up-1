# The ARM Rotation Scheme

![ARM7 internal data path](../Assets/Photos/ARM7%20internal%20data%20path.PNG)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This image here shows the internal data path of an ARM processor. That is just for an example. So here we have a simplified diagram of the data logic path of ARM7, including the barrel shifter and main adder (ALU).  
One use of the barrel shifter is to create constants. Barrel shifters are small circuits designed to move or rotate data. They can be built using very fast logic. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ARM's rotation method moves bits to the right using the inline barrel shifter, wrapping the least significant bit around to the most significant bit at the top. With 12 bits available in an instruction and dedicated hardware for performing shifts, ARM processors can generate classes of numbers, rather than each number, between 0 and 2 to the power of 32 minus 1. Analysis of common code shows that nearly half of all constants lie in the range between minus 15 and 15. And about 90 percent of them lie between minus 511 and 511.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So generally we also need large but simple constants, like 0x400, for masks and defining base addresses in memory, as we will see. So while not every constant is possible using this method, as we will see later, it is still possible to place any 32 number into a register using the scheme.

![rotation scheme](../Assets/Photos/rotation%20scheme_example1.PNG)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the rotation scheme available to us, we can load the constants directly into registers or use them in data operations like this. We can do something like move r0, 0xFF and this actually makes r0 equal to 255 in decimal. And this instruction here, with the rotation scheme, we can use the instruction here, move r0, 0x1, 30, to give us r0 equal to 30.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is possible because we have 12 bits available in an instruction and dedicated hardware like the barrel shifter that helps with the rotation method.  
Let's look at an example :   

![rotation scheme_example2](../Assets/Photos/rotation%20scheme_example2.PNG)  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, since four thousand eighty in binary is represented as 111111110000, and a byte is simply 11111111, which is equivalent to 0xFF, we can rotate that byte to the left by four bits and get the 4080 value we're looking for. However, the rotation scheme rotates a byte only to the right. Therefore, we need to calculate how many four left rotations become right rotations. A left rotation of n bits is equivalent to a right rotation of 32 - n bits. And this gives us the correct rotation. So, a four-bit rotation to the left is equivalent to a twenty-eight-bit rotation to the right. We simply say 32 - n bits, where n is the number of left rotations. So we have a rotation factor of 28.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So really, by just using the rotation scheme, we can get the number four thousand eighty into a simple number as simple as 0xFF, which is a byte—a single byte—like this. And it can be directly loaded into a register. So this value is a 12-bit value, right? But we can't use, we can't directly load a 12-bit value using the move instruction here. We cannot move this value, here, like this. The move instruction cannot use 12 bits, it's beyond its limitations. The move instruction can use a maximum of 8 bits. We can only move an 8-bit value using move r0, the number 255. That's our limit. But with the rotation scheme, we can rotate and have a 12-bit value stored in r0 and still use the move instruction. So that's the importance of the rotation scheme.


# Loading Constants with the LDR Instruction

![Loading Constants with the LDR Instruction](../Assets/Photos/Loading%20Constants%20with%20the%20LDR%20Instruction.PNG)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When writing an assembly we should use the following pseudo instructions to load constants into a register. It may be unusual to use pseudo instructions but there is a valid reason to do so. For most programmers, contents are declared at the start of this section of code at it maybe necessary to change the value as code is written, modified and maintained bt other programmers.  
For example : 

![Loading Constants with the LDR Instruction_example](../Assets/Photos/Loading%20Constants%20with%20the%20LDR%20Instruction_example.PNG)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the value of SRAM_BASE changes to a value that can't be generated using the byte rotation scheme, the code will crashes ad it'll generate an error. So to be safe, to safety execute this code in all instances, we have to use `LDR  r0,=SRAM_BASE`. We have to use load instruction rather than simply moving to r0 because this is constantly declared over here, we can changes\ this value at any time  
If we end up changing it to a value that can't be generated using the bute rotation scheme, than the program will fail to run properly.


# Loading Constants with the MOVW and MOVT Instructions

# Loading Labels with ADR, ADRL and LDR Instructions

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<R<Rd>d>,label  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can use it to put an address into a register whenever possible. However, the address can't be more than 255 bytes away. If the address is word aligned.  
If we use `ADR` and it fails to put the address in a register, we can use this variant of `ADRL`. And this will calculate an offset that is within plus or minus 64 kilobyte range. For an address that is not word-aligned and plus or minus 256 kilobytes for a word-aligned address.  

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADRL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<R<Rd>d>,label    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whenever you use `ADR` and it tells you, you get an error "out of range", an error that talks about your address being out of range, you just switch to `ADRL` and it will work. Note also that `ADRL` pseudo instruction generates 2 operations. So just remember this, we can use `ADRL` to load the address into a register, but the address has to be in a particular range. It doesn't have to be 255 bte away. If you try to put an address into a register which is too far away, you would receive an error of "offset being out of range", or something of that sort. If what occurs, you just switch to using `ADRL`.  

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LDR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<R<Rd>d>,label  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also we can use this pseudo instruction. And we use this is, we plan to reference labels in other sections of the code, or we know that a literal table exist and we don't mind the extra cycles. Used to fetch literal from the memory.  

>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LDR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<R<Rd>d>,constant  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally we can use this as we saw earlier.  
  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, they are labels and labels are basically you can think of them as a place to branch into. So we use a label each module or each subroutine in the assembly has a label so to branch a particular subroutine, we just call the label name.
